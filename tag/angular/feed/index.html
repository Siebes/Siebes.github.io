<p>Last week I had the honor (horror?) of trying to track down a performance issue we were facing in Angular when clicking on a filter that redraws a section of the page.</p>



<p>Below is a screenshot of a recording I did of performance when clicking on the filter. It looks very similar to what I stared at pulling my hair out for a good few days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide"><img src="https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-1024x262.png" alt="" class="wp-image-462" srcset="https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-1024x262.png 1024w, https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-300x77.png 300w, https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-768x196.png 768w, https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-434x111.png 434w, https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1-868x222.png 868w, https://siebert.dev/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/performance-1.png 1472w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>The click event is taking 4 seconds</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking down the call stack I could see change detection going crazy making me think this was something Angular related. I scoured through all the code that is run when redrawing the page. It looked fine; not 100% efficient but innocuous.</p>



<p>Then I noticed something very strange&#8230; in my local development environment everything was fast. Which made sense because a click event taking 4 seconds would drive us developers crazy. But as soon as it was deployed to the environment it would turn to garbage.</p>



<p>To prove it was environment related I asked around when people started to notice issues and deployed some code from early in the year which still had the same performance issues.</p>



<p>Next I started deleting scripts &#8211; starting off with the biggest culprits (analytics &#8211; which wasn&#8217;t it) and working my way down to less important scripts when I noticed that removing the Drupal Core Autocomplete code sped the whole site up.</p>



<p>To this day I still don&#8217;t know why this happened. But this small happening sent me completely off the wrong trail for a whole day. Eventually after exhausting this dead end I went back to analyzing all the other scripts on the page and found the culprit.</p>


<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
$('body').on(&quot;DOMSubtreeModified&quot;, function() {
   // some lovely stuff
});
</pre>


<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
