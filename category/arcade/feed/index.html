<p>As part of my ongoing Vewlix Arcade Project today I was experimenting with how a latching switch could be used to swap the audio between headphones and the arcades speakers.</p>

</div><figcaption>A simple test I did to work out how a switch works</figcaption></figure>



<p>The switch uses spade connectors so I had to practice making those connections using a crimping tool which was fairly easy.</p>



<p>The switch has 6 quick connects. The middle 2 connectors are the output and the top and bottom two connectors are the 2 inputs you can switch with. In the above example I didn&#8217;t use all 6 connectors, but only 3. This is because I ran ground to both LED lights regardless of switch status.</p>



<p>Not needing to wire ground through the switch is important because when I strip a 3.5mm connection I should get a cable for the left channel, right channel and ground. This gives me just enough inputs on the switch to finish the job! (You can buy switches that support more though).</p>



<p>After that test I worked on setting up this blog! As of this post its running on a $5 droplet on digital ocean. Originally I was going to use Cloudways but I worked out it would be just as easy to set up myself.</p>
